Who
 
we
 
are
 
-
 
and
 
who
 
we
 
aren’t
 
 
We
 
are
 
LNDR,
 
an
 
activewear
 
brand
 
for
 
sweaty,
 
successful,
 
grounded
 
adults.
 
 
 
We
 
create
 
technically
 
advanced,
 
precision
 
engineered
 
garments
 
that
 
do
 
what
 
they
 
say
 
they’re
 
going
 
to.
 
We’re
 
 
 
 
We
 
are….
 
We
 
aren’t
 
No
 
bullshit.
 
We’re
 
grounded,
 
clear
 
and
 
focused.
 
We
 
say
 
what
 
we
 
mean,
 
and
 
we
 
speak
 
plainly.
 
 
You-go-girl
 
positive.
 
We
 
don’t
 
do
 
condescending
 
or
 
forced.
 
We
 
deﬁnitely
 
don’t
 
do
 
toxic
 
positivity.
 
 
Grown
 
up.
 
We’re
 
for
 
adults,
 
by
 
adults.
 
 
Doing
 
it
 
for
 
the
 
‘Gram.
 
We
 
don’t
 
do
 
scrunch
 
butt,
 
or
 
prints,
 
or
 
trend-lead
 
colourways.
 
 
Witty.
 
We’ll
 
get
 
a
 
bit
 
spicy
 
and
 
spiky.
 
Our
 
humour
 
is
 
grounded
 
in
 
honesty,
 
and
 
a
 
willingness
 
to
 
say
 
things
 
other
 
brands
 
won’t.
 
 
Childish
 
or
 
try-hard.
 
We’re
 
not
 
afraid
 
to
 
work,
 
but
 
we
 
never
 
reach
 
for
 
a
 
joke.
 
We
 
don’t
 
do
 
cringe.
 
 
Unafraid
 
to
 
be
 
ourselves.
 
We
 
don’t
 
make
 
things
 
for
 
the
 
sake
 
of
 
it
 
-
 
and
 
we
 
don’t
 
say
 
things
 
just
 
to
 
grab
 
attention.
 
 
Following
 
trends
 
or
 
memes.
 
 
 
How
 
we
 
speak
 
We
 
have
 
integrity
 
 
Everything
 
we
 
say
 
has
 
a
 
purpose.
 
We’re
 
clear
 
and
 
honest
 
with
 
our
 
audience
 
-
  
they’re
 
adults,
 
they’re
 
smart,
 
they
 
can
 
handle
 
the
 
truth.
  
 
 
Just
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
sensual
 
Imagine
 
you’re
 
two
 
negronis
 
in
 
and
 
describing
 
how
 
your
 
favourite
 
leggings
 
feel.
 
We’re
 
all
 
about
 
how
 
our
 
products
 
make
 
you
 
feel,
 
and
 
we’re
 
not
 
afraid
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
little
 
spicy
 
when
 
we
 
need
 
to.
 
We
 
use
 
big,
 
vivid,
 
speciﬁc
 
and
 
descriptive
 
language
 
to
 
convey
 
feeling.
 
 
 
We
 
respect
 
our
 
audience
 
Our
 
audience
 
work
 
hard,
 
they
 
play
 
hard,
 
and
 
they
 
can
 
see
 
through
 
bullshit.
 
We’re
 
always
 
asking
 
ourselves
 
-
 
are
 
we
 
respecting
 
our
 
audience
 
with
 
what
 
we’re
 
saying
 
and
 
how
 
we’re
 
saying
 
it?
 

 
Meet
 
our
 
girl
 
The
 
LNDR
 
girl
 
is
 
that
 
girl
 
-
 
the
 
fun,
 
sophisticated,
 
hard-working
 
friend
 
you’re
 
low-key
 
intimidated
 
by.
 
 
 
She’s
 
smart,
 
accomplished
 
and
 
knows
 
her
 
worth
 
without
 
being
 
full
 
of
 
herself.
 
 
 
She’s
 
engaged
 
with
 
pop
 
culture
 
-
 
she
 
was
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
one
 
in
 
your
 
friend
 
group
 
to
 
watch
 
‘Severance’
 
and
 
her
 
podcast
 
recommendations
 
are
 
elite
 
-
 
but
 
she’s
 
not
 
the
 
type
 
to
 
live
 
tweet
 
‘Love
 
Island.’
 
 
 
She
 
loves
 
a
 
negroni,
 
a
 
steak,
 
a
 
taco,
 
or
 
a
 
cheeky
 
margarita.
 
 
 
She
 
doesn’t
 
really
 
do
 
high
 
street
 
junk
 
food
 
or
 
bottomless
 
brunch.
 
 
 
Music-wise,
 
she’s
 
not
 
really
 
a
 
pop
 
girly,
 
but
 
she’ll
 
wheel
 
up
 
some
 
Charli
 
XCX
 
to
 
get
 
her
 
pumped
 
for
 
the
 
gym.
 
We
 
can
 
neither
 
conﬁrm
 
nor
 
deny
 
that
 
you’ve
 
seen
 
her
 
on
 
a
 
Boiler
 
Room
 
livestream
 
(you
 
totally
 
have).
 
 
 
 
Our
 
language
 
toolkit
 
Words
 
and
 
phrases
 
we
 
use
 
We
 
want
 
our
 
language
 
to
 
be
 
clean,
 
precise,
 
speciﬁc
 
and
 
evocative.
 
 
 
When
 
we
 
use
 
superlatives,
 
we
 
opt
 
for
 
language
 
that
 
nods
 
to
 
technical
 
superiority
 
and
 
sensuality.
 
 
 
Our
 
adjectives
 
are
 
speciﬁc
 
and
 
grounded.
 
They
 
should
 
evoke
 
the
 
feeling
 
of
 
the
 
product,
 
almost
 
as
 
though
 
you
 
could
 
touch
 
it
 
through
 
the
 
screen.
 
 
When
 
we
 
talk
 
about
 
our
 
design
 
and
 
philosophy
 
as
 
a
 
brand
 
we
 
use
 
speciﬁc,
 
technical
 
language.
 
We
 
stand
 
for
 
something,
 
and
 
against
 
something,
 
and
 
we’re
 
not
 
afraid
 
to
 
say
 
it.

Bland
 
language
 
is
 
like

It’s
 
so
 
dull
 
that
 
you
 
just
 
don’t
 
see
 
it.
 
We’re
 
not

We’re
 
not

We
 
avoid

language.
 
We
 
never
 
try
 
too

Overused
 
language
 
is
 
also
 
like

This
 
is
 
the
 
language
 
that
 
so
 
many
 
brands
 
use
 
that
 
it’s
 
like
 
white
 
noise.
 
 
 
Tonally

language
 
just
 
doesn’t

LNDR.

When

on

it’s
 
like
 
you’re
 
sitting

them
 
at
 
a

You’re

Always
 
keep
 
our

Responding
 
to
 
compliments
 
We
 
play
 
back
 
the
 
customer’s
 
language
 
to
 
them
 
as
 
a
 
playful
 
compliment,
 
while
 
expressing
 
our
 
gratitude.
 
Keep
 
your

human
 
-
 
you’d
 
never

a

Elegant

LNDR:
 
We
 
can
 
tell
 
you’ve
 
got
 
great
 
taste.
 
So
 
glad
 
you’re
 
feeling
 
our
 
new
 
palette.
 
 
 
Community:
 
Top
 
marks
 
to
 
the
 
reviewer.
 
And
 
top
 
marks
 
to
 
the
 
leggings.
 
Love
 
all
 
my
 
three
 
pairs
 
of
 
them!
 
LNDR:
 
We
 
love
 
a
 
true
 
LNDR
 
head,
 
and
 
we’ll
 
gratefully
 
take
 
our
 
top

Hope
 
you’re
 
giving
 
your
 
leggings
 
a
 
run
 
for
 
their
 
money.

WE
 
ARE
 
LNDR
 
AND
 
WE’RE
 
HERE
 
TO
 
CUT
 
THROUGH
 
THE
 
BLLSHT.
 
 
 
LNDR
 
was
 
founded
 
by
 
3
 
less-than-perfect
 
women,
 
without
 
celebrity
 
status.
  
No
 
Victoria
 
Secret
 
figures
 
or
 
instagram
 
blue
 
ticks.
 
With
 
less
 
than
 
400
 
followers
 
combined
 
and
 
not
 
a
 
six
 
pack
 
in
 
sight.
 
Women
 
that
 
enjoyed
 
working
 
out
 
-
 
that
 
grew
 
up
 
competing
 
in
 
sports,
 
travelled
 
parts
 
of
 
the
 
world
 
by
 
foot
 
and
 
bike
 
and
 
found
 
their
 
way
 
to
 
London
 
with
 
a
 
healthy
 
addiction
 
to
 
workout
 
classes.
 
The
 
team
 
soon
 
grew
 
to
 
include
 
skilled
 
individuals
 
passionate

Description
 Years in the making, the Locked + Loaded High-Impact Sports Bra has been meticulously designed and developed to provide a full lockdown (Melbourne style) This one is for the women with a bit more to manage, a good handful or more (C cup and up) And workouts that require more than a downward dog. Anything you can do, now your boobs can do too. Zero bounce, without digging in or rubbing and all while looking good enough to go topless. This bra has a unique internal "no bounce" layer that locks the girls down while maintaining shape and definition. It also features fixed adjustable straps, so it doesn't loosen over time during your workout, and a secondary back clasp to ensure maximum support in all directions. The branded elastic along back edge maintains a high level of stretch to mitigate digging in without losing support and there's padded straps for extra comfort.  Summary: If you have a C cup or higher and enjoy a high impact / high movement workout this is the 
one
 
you've
 
been
 
waiting
 
for.
